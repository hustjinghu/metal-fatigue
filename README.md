# metal-fatigue

Goal: Create a library for fatigue analysis of metals. Currently I'm thinking of the following features to build:
- signal processing:
    - counting methods (rainflow counting,...)
    - arithmetic
    - statistical methods (extrapolation,...)
- evaluation of standard experiments (ASTM standatd routines + others)
    - Incremental Step Test (IST)
    - woehlers test (stress based and strain based)
    - crack growth
- damage calculation
    - Miners rule
    - damage parameter
